## Acknowlegement

- I took up this project as a lockdown hobby but later turned it into a serious project as I had to do something for my University Assignment.

- The Pandemic was very booring and monotonic so I thought of making something which is necessary and fulfils the following criterias :-

  i) Useful

  ii) Easy to use

  iii) Minimalistic UX design

  iv) Uses some GUI framework

- The calculators already available online had the following shortcommings according to my study on calculator applications :-

  i) Complex to use

  ii) Had a very basic design

  iii) Had no themes

  iv) Had no special features like AOT\*, Hover

  v) Had no have Scientific mode

  vi) Was not so user friendly

- Also those days I could'nt find an appropriate calculator application online which suited my choice and designs.

- So I thought why not try to build one for myself and the community. :)
